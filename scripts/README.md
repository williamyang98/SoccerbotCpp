| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| emulator | Runs soccer minigame |
| training-tensorflow | Train onnx and tflite models in tensorflow |
| training-pytorch | Train onnx models in pytorch |
| generator | Module for generating training data |

**NOTE:** Use the pytorch backend preferrably since the tensorflow directml plugin is extremely buggy and crashes alot. Also training tends to be much faster with pytorch.
